Heathcliff: Cathy, are you busy this afternoon? Are you going anywhere?
Catherine: No, it is raining.
Heathcliff: Why have you that silk frock on, then? Nobody coming here, I hope?
Catherine: Not that I know of, but you should be in the field now, Heathcliff. It is an hour past dinnertime. I thought you were gone.
Heathcliff: Hindley does not often free us from his accursed presence. I'll not work any more today. I'll stay with you.
Catherine: Oh, but Joseph will tell. You'd better go!
Heathcliff: Joseph is loading lime on the further side of Penistone Craggs; it will take him till dark, and he'll never know.
Catherine: Isabella and Edgar Linton talked of calling this afternoon. As it rains, I hardly expect them; but they may come, and if they do, you run the risk of being scolded for no good.
Heathcliff: Order Ellen to say you are engaged, Cathy. Don't turn me out for those pitiful, silly friends of yours!
