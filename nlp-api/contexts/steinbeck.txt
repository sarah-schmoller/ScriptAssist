Shopkeeper: You folks aim to buy anything? Gasoline or stuff?
Al: Need some gas, mister.
Shopkeeper: Got any money?
Al: Sure, think we're beggin?
Shopkeeper: Well, that's all right, folks. Help yourself to water. Road is full a people, come in, use water, dirty up the toilet, and then, by God, they'll steal stuff and don't buy nothin. Got no money to buy with. Come beggin a gallon gas to move on.
Tom: We're payin our way. You got no call to give us a goin-over. We ain't asked you for nothin.
Shopkeeper: I ain't. Just help yourself to water, and go use the toilet if you want. I don't know what the country's comin to. Fifty-sixty folks go by every day, folks all movin west with kids and household stuff. Where they goin? What they gonna do?
Tom: Doin the same as us. Goin someplace to live. Tryin to get along. That's all.
