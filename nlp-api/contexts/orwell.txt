Mrs Parsons: Oh, comrade, I thought I heard you come in. Do you think you could come across and have a look at our kitchen sink? It's got blocked up. Of course, it's only because Tom isn't home.
Winston: Have you got a spanner?
Mrs Parsons: A spanner. I don't know, I'm sure.
Child: Up with your hands! You're a traitor! You're a thought criminal! You're a Eurasian spy! I'll shoot you, I'll vaporize you, I'll send you to the salt mines!
Mrs Parsons: They do get so noisy. They're disappointed because they couldn't go to see the hanging, that's what it is. I'm too busy to take them and Tom won't be back from work in time.
Child: Why can't we go and see the hanging?
