Nick: You're a rotten driver. Either you ought to be more careful, you you oughtn't to drive at all.
Jordan: I am careful.
Nick: No, you're not.
Jordan: Well, other people are.
Nick: What's that got to do with it?
Jordan: They'll keep out of my way. It takes two to make an accident.
Nick: Suppose you met somebody just as careless as yourself.
Jordan: I hope I never will. I hate careless people. That's why I like you.
